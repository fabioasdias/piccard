# Piccard
Visualizing demographic evolution using geographically inconsistent census data

Prototype for the exploration and analysis of inconsistent region-based data. We use census as the example, but it should work with any tabulation data where the geometries change over time.






- How about we call it “Piccard”. Jacques Piccard was the first person to explore the deepest part of the oceans (with Don Walsh).  As your tool provides a deep dive into data, it may be apropos. - Mark

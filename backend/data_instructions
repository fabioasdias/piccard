I hit a few snags using data from US/IPUMS. The .prj is weird and qgis doesn't quite understand it. Mapbox does, but in bad zoom ranges.

To make the shapefiles better:
ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" -t_srs EPSG:4326 US_tract_2010.shp ../US_tract_2010.shp

Then put it in the 'shapefiles' subfolder, in the way the Makefile expects them.

Now to fix the zoom ranges:
ogr2ogr -f GeoJson US_tract_1970.geojson US_tract_1970.shp

tippecanoe -o US_tract_1970.mbtiles -Z 2 -z 20 US_tract_1970.geojson;tippecanoe -o US_tract_1980.mbtiles -Z 2 -z 20 US_tract_1980.geojson;tippecanoe -o US_tract_1990.mbtiles -Z 2 -z 20 US_tract_1990.geojson; tippecanoe -o US_tract_2000.mbtiles -Z 2 -z 20 US_tract_2000.geojson;tippecanoe -o US_tract_2010.mbtiles -Z 2 -z 20 US_tract_2010.geojson


then upload that to mapbox. Get the ID and datasource strings and put in conf.json, on the backend folder

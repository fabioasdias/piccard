        <h1>Documentation</h1>

        <p>If you just want to know how to play with the interface, <a
        href="#ui">skip ahead to the prototype interface documentation.</a></p>

        <p>The objective of this page is to briefly overview the data and
        methods used and explain how to interpret the results illustrated in the
        interface. No expert knowledge is required beyond a basic grasp of
        statistics (specifically, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot">boxplots</a>).</p>

        <h2>Overview and objectives</h2>
            <p>The objective of this prototype is to <b>explore census data</b>.
            To ease the understanding, we employ <i>data clustering</i> to
            simplify the information, which is fairly commonplace for this
            analysis. In this scenario, a <i>cluster</i> is a set of geographic
            regions that are more similar to themselves than to the other
            regions.</p>

            <p>The objectives of this project are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow and easy understanding of what clusters are present on a geographic region (city, metro, etc).</li>
                <li>How these clusters evolved over time, both spatially and in content.</li>
            </ul>
            
        <h2>Data</h2>
            <p>We used data from <a
            href="https://data2.nhgis.org/main">NHGIS</a>, for the USA, using
            census years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010, and from <a
            href="http://dc.chass.utoronto.ca/census/">CHASS</a> for Canada,
            census years 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001, and 2011. Neither allows
            redistribution of the data, which is why our prototype does not
            export the results in a downloadable format. In both cases, we used
            <b>census tracts</b> as the basic geographic unit.</p>

            <p>When dealing with census data, the main challenge is the lack of
            uniformity on the measurements. Everything changes, from the shapes
            of the census tracts, to what variables are measured and what each
            measured variable actually means. Here <b>the spatial changes do not
            matter</b>, because the method was developed specifically to deal
            with different geographic regions, but we still had to find the
            correspondences between the variables across different years. Since
            the objective of this work is to demonstrate that the prototype
            works, not do a deep analysis, we only matched a subset of the
            available variables, just enough for it to be useful, we hope. </p>

            <p>More importantly, we did not consider each measurement as an
            separate entity, but we grouped them into <i>aspects</i> (for lack
            of a better term). Each aspect is then characterised by a
            probability distribution of its values, for instance, the aspect
            "Race" in the USA includes White; Black; Indian, eskimo and
            aleut;Asian, Hawaiian, other pacific islander; and other.</p>

            <p>Since each aspect is a probability distribution (an histogram, to
            be precise), we can compare any two regions without further
            concerns. There are many ways to compare two probability
            distributions, but we adopted a simple euclidian distance between
            the vectors, because it gave reasonable results and it is fast to
            compute.</p>

            <a name="income"></a>
            <p><b style="color:red">ATTENTION - INCOME</b>: While some aspects
            match perfectly between census years (age, for one),  income does
            not. We adjusted the values using publicly available inflation data
            and considered rather large ranges, but the results are not
            absolutely reliable. They are not wrong either, as far as we know,
            but should be interpreted with <b>extreme caution</b>. For instance,
            there is a "baseline" oscillation in all cities of both countries,
            most likely caused by a slight mismatch in the values, that should
            not be confused with actual change in the data. Additionally,
            acurately adjusting historical monetary values is a challenging
            problem by itself, and out of the scope here.</p>

            <p>For the details of which census field went where, <a href="#appendix">click here</a>.</p>

            <p>For the USA, we used: Education level, Family Income, Marital
            status, Occupation, and Race. For Canada: Age, Education level, Home
            language, Household income, Marital status, Occupation, Place of birth, and Religion</p>


        <h2>Clustering method</h2>
            <h3>Data representation and geographic relationships</h3>
                <p>One of the main differences of this work is that we use a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graph</a>
                to represent the census tracts. Each CT is represented as node,
                with probability distributions of each aspect, and we place
                edges between the nodes of CTs that share geographic boundaries.
                Since we also have temporal evolution, we connect the graphs of
                each year, by linking regions that spatially overlap, leading to
                a single graph (with possibly several connected components).</p>

            <h3>Watershed cuts and hierarchies</h3>

                <p>The actual clustering method is based on the <a
                href="https://hal-upec-upem.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00622410/document">Watershed
                cuts</a> algorithm for graphs, coupled with an <a
                href="http://sibgrapi2017.ic.uff.br/e-proceedings/assets/papers/TP/147.pdf">greedy
                edge matching method</a>, leading to a result that is not a
                single clustering, but an <i>hierarchy</i>. This hierarchical
                result is what allows the easy change in the numbers of
                clusters, without the need to redo the computational
                process.</p>

            <h3>Aspect Weights</h3>
                <p>The user can assign different weights to each aspect. By
                default, their values is equal to one. Use this parameter to
                increase/decrease the importance of the <i>differences</i> in
                each aspect. For instance, using "Race" with weight one and
                "Income" with weight two means that a difference in race needs
                to have twice the value as one in income to be equally
                distinctive, leading to a clustering that mostly considers
                differences in Income, using Race as a "tie breaker" of
                sorts.</p>

            <h3>Augmented edges</h3>
                <p>One slight caveat of Watershed cuts is that each cluster is
                composed of a connected subgraph of the original graph. In other
                words, if we have to separate sets of census tracts, with
                identical features (aspects), they will form two distinct
                clusters, which is not ideal for this specific application.</p>

                <p>To overcome this, we augment the original graph with edges
                from a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_graph">K-NN
                graph</a>, generated without considering the geographic
                information. In this example, these edges will connect the two
                previously disconnected regions, assigning both regions to the
                same cluster. The number of edges that are added to <i> each
                node of the graph</i> is a parameter on the configuration panel
                of the method, from 1 to 10. Therefore, this parameter controls
                the how much the geographic information will influence the
                clustering result, because it limits the options for each
                cluster to "grow". </p>

                <p>Low values  will give more importance to geographic proximity
                and lead to geographically "continous" clusters with more intra
                cluster variance. With a higher value, the method will
                essentially ignore the geographic information (most CTs have
                less than 10 geographic edges) and lead to scattered clusters
                with smaller intra-cluster variance. </p>

                <p>The effect of this parameter also depends on the data under
                analysis. The difference can be subtle, as illustrated by this
                clustering of Race in Chicago: (the colours indicate clusters
                and are not consistent across different configurations)</p>

        <h2>Prototype interface</h2>
            

            <p><b style="color:red">Important</b>: The results are computed on
            request, then saved and reused if the same configuration is requested
            again. The default configuration is probably already saved for every
            region, so the results are generally fast to load. However, more
            "exotic" parameters (custom weights, removing variables) will need to be
            processed, and that might take a while (around 5 minutes for
            Chicago/LA/etc). When that happens, the page might crash, or just get
            stuck with the "loading" message forever. Just refresh the page after a
            few minutes and try again, the server will have processed the request
            and it should load quickly. I do apologise for this.
            </p>

            <h3>Trajectories</h3>
                <p>For each little piece of the region under analysis we can
                associate the corresponding cluster over time. We can this
                sequence a <i>trajectory</i>.</p>

            <h3>The interface</h3>

                <img width="100%" src="chicago_Race_e1.png">

                <p>This image illustrates the whole interface, considering Chicago,
                Race with weight 1, 1 augmented edge. The current configuration is
                shown at the top left of the interface.</p>

                <p>The panel on the left contains the current configuration, the
                other configuration controls, including for the number of clusters,
                and a overview of what composes each cluster. The other panels on
                the top display how the clusters evolved over time (the different
                trajectories), including the percentage of changes between them, and
                an overview map, illustrating the cluster evolution for the whole
                considered period.</p>

                <p>The bottom part of the interface contains the details for the
                selected regions, with maps illustrating which CTs are used, since
                they can be different over time, and plot comparing the selected
                region against the whole.</p>

            <h3>Overview of cluster composition</h3>
                <p>The left panel contains one boxplot per cluster, illustrating
                the aspect that better characterises that cluster. <b>It was not
                necessarily used for the clustering</b>, but it is the one with
                less overlap between the 25% and 75% quantiles. We define
                <i>relevance</i> as the distance between the interquantile
                ranges, meaning that an aspect is relevant if those specific
                values are not present in the other classes. The relevance of an
                aspect is the maximum relevance of its composing variables. </p>
                
                <p>The relevance is represented by the colour of the
                interquantile box. The whiskers represent the maximum and
                minimum. To allow for an easier comparison, the quantiles <i>of
                the other clusters</i> are represented in gray. The user can
                expand that panel and see all the aspects of that cluster, or
                all of them at the same time.</p>
                <center>
                    <img src="chicago_e1_expOv.png">
                </center>
                <p>In this image, we can see that the yellow cluster corresponds
                a concentration (~70%) of people that identify as "Asian,
                Hawaiian, other pacific islander" and that this is unique to
                this cluster. The other boxplots are ordered by relevance, left
                to right, but there are no more relevant aspects, with all
                "boxes" almost in the same position. This means that, while Race
                is a relevant aspect for this clustering, the other variables
                are not, and have similar values across the different clusters.
                This can be confirmed by clicking on "view all":</p>

                </center>

            <h3>Trajectories</h3>
               <p>We defined a <i>trajectory</i> as the sequence of clusters
                assigned to a specific region. This allows for the study of the
                <b>changes</b> in the demographic groups.</p>

                <p>The trajectories are depicted using a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram">Sankey
                diagram</a>, where the width is proportional to the population involved.</p>
                <center>
                    <img src="chicago_e1_sankey.png">
                </center>
                <p>We can see that the green cluster contains more people,
                followed by the orange, and that the yellow cluster is small.
                The clusters are mostly stable, with a large trajectory composed
                by the green cluster on all times. A better explanation on the
                colour choices is <a href="#colours">here</a>.</p>



                <p>Another way of identifying change is using the cluster
                changes matrix, which indicates the percentage of the population
                of a given cluster that was later classified into another cluster.</p>
                <center>
                        <img src="chicago_e1_transmat.png">
                </center>
                <p>In this image, we can see that, considering all years, 95% of
                the population in the green cluster stayed green, while 5%
                became orange and 1% yellow. The total is not 100% due to
                rounding.</p>
    
                <p>The panel on the top right depicts the geographic positions
                of the trajectories, considering all years (the other maps show
                the clustering results for specific years).</p>

                <p>More importantly, <b>the user can select trajectories</b>.
                The "Selection mode" control on the left panel allows the user
                to Set the selection, Add to the selection, or remove from it.
                The button next to it clears the selection. The bottom part of
                the interface will then show details <b>for the selected
                trajectories</b> (or for the whole, if nothing is selected).</p>
                
            <a name="colours"></a>
            <h3>Colours, simplified?</h3>
                <p>In this work, we use colours to represent the clusters and
                the trajectories. That is the reason the number of clusters is
                limited to 8, we cannot really tell colours apart beyond that.
                However, we have considerably more trajectories, so we are left
                with a conundrum: <i>Do we accurately represent each different
                trajectory with a different colour or do we use small set of
                colours and paint different, but similar, trajectories in the
                same colour?</i> Well, instead of "solving" this problem, we
                made both options available, let the users decide. </p>

                <p><b>Simplified colours</b>: When this is active, the colours
                on the interface are determined by the rule:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If a region belongs to the same cluster on all
                        years, use the colour of that cluster,</li>
                        <li>If a region belongs to a given cluster for most of
                        the years (simple majority), use a "lighter" version of
                        the colour of the cluster,</li>
                        <li>Gray otherwise.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p><b>Non-simplified colours</b>: When this is <b>not</b>
                active, the colours on the interface are determined as the
                average of the colours of the involved clusters.
                </p>

            <h3>Characterization of the selected trajectories</h3>
                <p>The bottom part of the interface corresponds to the
                <i>details</i>, either for the whole region under analysis or
                the selected trajectories.</p>

                <p>Following the Chicago example, this is what happens when the
                user selects all trajectories involving the yellow cluster (by
                clicking on the yellow bar over the boxplot)</p>

                <center>
                    <img src="chicago_Race_yellow.png" width="100%">
                </center>

                <p>The population numbers, under the maps, now consider only the
                selected CTs (displayed in the maps), along with the
                corresponding percentage of the population (wrt the whole). </p>

                <p>Under it, we have one row for each aspect, with rectangles
                that represent the average proportion of each subpart of the
                aspect. We can easily see that about half of the population in
                these regions is married, for instance. Each aspect can be
                expanded, revealing more details, including a comparison against
                the whole region, in this image, Race is expanded. The black
                area corresponds to the interquantile ranges for the selection,
                the dashed line to the maximum and minimum for the selection,
                the gray area corresponds to the global interquantile
                ranges.</p>

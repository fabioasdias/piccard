abstract="Although residential segregation is known to have declined for some racial groups in America, much less is known about change in the relative socioeconomic quality of the neighborhoods where different racial and ethnic groups live. Using census data for 1980--2010, we find that the neighborhoods where whites and minorities reside have become more alike in terms of neighborhood poverty and median income, largely because whites now live in poorer neighborhoods and because African Americans live in less-poor neighborhoods. The narrowing of black-white neighborhood inequality since 1980 has been sizable, far exceeding the narrowing of Hispanic-white neighborhood inequality; nonetheless, despite blacks' relative gains, the disparity in black-white neighborhood economic conditions remains very large. Asian Americans, on the other hand, now reside in neighborhoods that are economically similar to the neighborhoods where whites reside. Regression analyses reveal that racial neighborhood inequality declined the most in U.S. metropolitan areas where racial residential segregation declined the most.",

As part of a larger, primary study to determine a possible association between travel barriers to pediatric cancer facilities and adolescent cancer mortality across the United States, we examined methods to estimate mortality within zones at varying distances from these facilities: (1) geographic centroid assignment, (2) population-weighted centroid assignment, (3) simple areal weighting, (4) combined population and areal weighting, and (5) geostatistical areal interpolation. For the primary study, we used county mortality counts from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and population data by census tract for the United States to estimate zone mortality. In this paper, to evaluate the five mortality estimation methods, we employed address-level mortality data from the state of Georgia in conjunction with census data. Our objective here is to identify the simplest method that returns accurate mortality estimates.},

  abstract  = {The United States is increasingly becoming a multi-racial society. To understand multiple consequences of this overall trend to our neighborhoods we need a methodology capable of spatio-temporal analysis of racial diversity at the local level but also across the entire U.S. Furthermore, such methodology should be accessible to stakeholders ranging from analysts to decision makers. In this paper we present a comprehensive framework for visualizing and analyzing diversity data that fulfills such requirements. The first component of our framework is a U.S.-wide, multi-year database of race sub-population grids which is freely available for download. These 30 m resolution grids have being developed using dasymetric modeling and are available for 1990-2000-2010. We summarize numerous advantages of gridded population data over commonly used Census tract-aggregated data. Using these grids frees analysts from constructing their own and allows them to focus on diversity analysis. The second component of our framework is a set of U.S.-wide, multi-year diversity maps at 30 m resolution. A diversity map is our product that classifies the gridded population into 39 communities based on their degrees of diversity, dominant race, and population density. It provides spatial information on diversity in a single, easy-to-understand map that can be utilized by analysts and end users alike. Maps based on subsequent Censuses provide information about spatio-temporal dynamics of diversity. Diversity maps are accessible through the GeoWeb application SocScape (http://sil.uc.edu/webapps/socscape_usa/) for an immediate online exploration. The third component of our framework is a proposal to quantitatively analyze diversity maps using a set of landscape metrics. Because of its form, a grid-based diversity map could be thought of as a diversity “landscape” and analyzed quantitatively using landscape metrics. We give a brief summary of most pertinent metrics and demonstrate how they can be applied to diversity maps.},

  abstract = { Rapid transformations sweeping the United States over the past 50 years have necessitated a reassessment of longstanding theories on how the neighborhood change process has unfolded. This article builds upon recent methodological advancements aimed at understanding longitudinal dynamics by developing a workflow that blends the self-organizing map and a sequential alignment method to visualize pathways of change in a multivariate context. It identifies the predominant pathways in which neighborhoods have changed according to their racial, ethnic, socioeconomic and housing characteristics in the largest US metropolitan statistical areas from 1980 to 2010. The distribution of these pathways is subsequently examined between metropolitan statistical areas and the spatial clustering of these trajectories within cities is analyzed. Results reveal a white-flight type process, the establishment of a multiethnic neighborhood, densification of single-family neighborhoods, gentrification in relatively diverse neighborhoods, upgrading of white single family neighborhoods, and the most frequent pathway of all: no change. High-poverty minority and wealthy white neighborhoods are most spatially compact and expanding in a contiguous manner, while multiethnic neighborhoods are relatively dispersed. Six groups of metropolitan statistical areas are identified based upon the similarity of their neighborhood composition. Parallels are drawn between the formation of enduring high-poverty black neighborhoods in Northern and Midwestern cities and the emergence of clusters high-poverty Hispanic neighborhoods in Hispanic destination cities. },

  abstract = { Multiscale segregation measures have the potential to increase understanding of residential context and ultimately a wide range of social and spatial processes. By examining segregation at multiple scales, we have the opportunity to study it as more than the outcome of a single process or a measure describing a single contextual effect. Multiscale segregation encourages us to look for sorting processes and contextual effects operating at different scales and potentially even with different meanings. However, the complexity of multiscale measures introduces significant uncertainty about the role of underlying data and assumptions in producing observed outcomes, particularly at fine geographic scales. While traditional measures of segregation have been exposed to decades of scrutiny, multiscale measures are still relatively novel and less well understood. The theoretical contribution of this paper is to consider the implications of segregation as both an outcome and signifier of sorting processes at multiple scales. The empirical contribution is to consider how zoning and the degree of spatial association shape outcomes expressed as multiscale segregation measures. I examine the effects of different allocation strategies for measuring population at small scales by comparing four delineation methods. I find that the method chosen for allocating population to small areas matters, but that by the time observation units reach about 700 m2 most of the difference between methods has washed out. I also test the effect of changing the degree of assumed spatial association in generating multiscale segregation measures. I find that, as suggested by Reardon and O'Sullivan in their original exposition of their spatial segregation measure, this assumption has a relatively small effect on outcomes and is unlikely to shape substantive findings. },

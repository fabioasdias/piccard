\begin{abstract}
  This paper proposes a novel method for data-driven
  identification of spatio-temporal homogeneous regions and their dynamics,
  enabling the exploration of their composition and extents.  Using a simple
  network representation, the method enables temporal regionalisation
  \emph{without the need for geographical harmonisation}.
    
  To allow for a transparent corroboration of our method, we use it as a basis
  for an interactive and intuitive interface for the progressive exploration of
  the results. The interface guides the user through the original data, enabling
  both experts and non-experts to characterise broad patterns of stability and
  change and identify detailed local processes.

  
  The proposed methodology is suitable for any region-based data, and we
  validate our method with illustrative scenarios from Chicago and Toronto, with
  results that match the established literature. The system is publicly
  available, with demographic data for over forty regions in the USA and Canada
  between 1970 and 2010.

\section{Conclusion}
The objective of this work was to demonstrate that temporal
regionalisation can be performed without geographical harmonisation. We
proposed an alternative methodology that robustly considers the data in its
original geography, without the creation of arbitrary artificial data points.

This methodology was then used to create a publicly accessible system, with an
interactive and intuitive interface, allowing a transparent evaluation and
replication of our results. We used this interface to corroborate results from
the literature and we hope that it will be used to corroborate future results as
well. 

The feedback from experts was positive and most of them were able to extract
insight from the prototype while indicating interest in using it for their
research efforts.  Since our interface can be used by non-experts as well, we
also contributed to scientific dissemination and stakeholder transparency in
urban sciences. Building on the comments of the experts and other colleagues
exposed to our prototype, a future iteration of this prototype would include a
simplified interface and faster computation times, but more importantly the
option to define the region of study and add more data. This would also allow
for a direct comparison between original and harmonised data, to further
validate the prototype, and explore if our approach offers any new insights.
Methodologically, the variable matching step is the current manual bottleneck of
the system, and the next target for removal. More importantly, we introduced a
new idea that, apparently, was never considered in the literature. While
significant resources have been invested to improve geographical harmonisation,
rarely, if at all, has anybody doubted that it was really necessary in the first
place. We proved that it is not necessary for regionalisation, especially for
neighbourhood effects and neighbourhood dynamics.

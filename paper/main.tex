% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.

%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated

% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as

\begin{abstract}
  We propose a visual analytics system that enables the exploration
  evolutionary patterns in geographically inconsistent data, removing the need to
  harmonize it into the same geographical regions, a time consuming and
  error-prone process that is currently used in virtually all longitudinal
  analysis of geographical data. This work also includes incremental developments
  in the representation, clustering, and visual exploration of geographical data.
  We illustrate it considering census data, where it allows an easier
  understanding of the demographic groups present in a city and their evolution
  over time. We present the feedback of experts in urban sciences and sociology,
  along with illustrative scenarios in the USA and Canada on the decennial
  censuses between 1970 and 2010.

\section{Conclusion}
Our objective was to allow for the exploration of census data without
geographical harmonization, an approach that is usually not considered. Our
method was able to corroborate previous findings from the specialized
literature, with an increased level of detail due to our data representation and
visualization choices. The feedback from experts was remarkably positive, most
of them were able to extract insight from the prototype and demonstrated
interest in using it on their research efforts.

While we focused on census data in this work, the proposed method can be used
with most similarly area-based datasets. Further, while there is interest in the
use of census data, it is mostly in combination with other, larger and more
dynamic, datasets. We postulate that, while census data is interesting, the
amount of effort required to obtain and prepare it often discourages its use as
complementary information, reinforcing our hypothesis that there is need for
methods that are able to deal with geographically inconsistent data.

\title{Sidestepping geographic harmonisation: a new method for handling data over evolving spatial regions}
%\author{Fabio Dias, Daniel Silver\\University of Toronto}
\author{}

\maketitle

% ====== CFP
% Neighborhoods are increasingly central constructs in the social sciences,
% serving as spatio-temporal frames for the analysis of a host of questions.
% Yet, much debate surrounds the role of neighborhood effects in many
% socioeconomic processes and the ability of traditional notions of
% neighborhoods to fully express context. Parallel to this, there have been
% calls for a move away from the view of neighborhoods as fixed-static
% containers and towards one where neighborhoods undergo dynamic evolution that
% requires study in its own right. Despite the recent renewed interest in
% neighborhood effects and neighborhood dynamics, these two literatures remain
% largely separate.

% This special issue seeks to redress this situation by bringing together recent
% work at the intersection of neighborhood effects and dynamics. We are inviting
% submissions dedicated to a special issue of Geographical Analysis on
% Neighborhood Dynamics and Neighborhood Effects. Papers in the following areas
% are particularly welcome, as long as they pertain to the general theme of the
% special issue:

% Neighborhood as context
% Neighborhood change
% Neighborhood exposure histories
% Spatial data science approaches to the neighborhood construct
% Neighborhood effects
% Longitudinal analysis of neighborhoods
% Boundary change and harmonization
% Use of novel data sources in neighborhood analysis
% Innovative qualitative, mixed-methods, or quantitative approaches for
% analyzing neighborhood dynamics or effects
% Geodemographic approaches
% Submissions will be refereed according to the standard procedures of Geographical Analysis.

\begin{abstract}
  \revision{1.1/2.1}{This paper proposes a novel method for data-driven
  identification of spatio-temporal homogeneous regions and their dynamics,
  enabling the exploration of their composition and extents.  Using a simple
  network representation, the method enables temporal regionalisation
  \emph{without the need for geographical harmonisation}.
    
  To allow for a transparent corroboration of our method, we use it as a basis
  for an interactive and intuitive interface for the progressive exploration of
  the results. The interface guides the user through the original data, enabling
  both experts and non-experts to characterise broad patterns of stability and
  change and identify detailed local processes.

  
  The proposed methodology is suitable for any region-based data, and we
  validate our method with illustrative scenarios from Chicago and Toronto, with
  results that match the established literature. The system is publicly
  available, with demographic data for over forty regions in the USA and Canada
  between 1970 and 2010.}

\section{Conclusion}
The objective of this work was to demonstrate that\revision{2.1}{ temporal
regionalisation can be performed without geographical harmonisation}. We
proposed an alternative methodology that robustly considers the data in its
original geography, without the creation of arbitrary artificial data points.

This methodology was then used to create a publicly accessible system, with an
interactive and intuitive interface, allowing a transparent evaluation and
replication of our results. We used this interface to corroborate results from
the literature and we hope that it will be used to corroborate future results as
well. 

The feedback from experts was positive and most of them were able to extract
insight from the prototype while indicating interest in using it for their
research efforts.  Since our interface can be used by non-experts as well, we
also contributed to scientific dissemination and stakeholder transparency in
urban sciences. \revision{1.12.6/2.6.5}{Building on the comments
of the experts and other colleagues exposed to our prototype, a future iteration
of this prototype would include a simplified interface and faster computation
times, but more importantly the option to define the region of study and add
more data. This would also allow for a direct comparison between original and
harmonised data, to further validate the prototype, and explore if our approach
offers any new insights. Methodologically, the variable matching step is the
current manual bottleneck of the system, and the next target for removal.}


More importantly, we introduced a new idea that, apparently, was never
considered in the literature. While significant resources have been invested to
improve geographical harmonisation, rarely, if at all, has anybody doubted that
it was really necessary in the first place. \revision{2.1}{We proved that it is 
not necessary for regionalisation, especially for neighbourhood effects and
neighbourhood dynamics.}

\title{Unharmonised longitudinal data processing using networks}
%\author{Fabio Dias, Daniel Silver\\University of Toronto}

\maketitle

% ====== CFP
% Neighborhoods are increasingly central constructs in the social sciences,
% serving as spatio-temporal frames for the analysis of a host of questions.
% Yet, much debate surrounds the role of neighborhood effects in many
% socioeconomic processes and the ability of traditional notions of
% neighborhoods to fully express context. Parallel to this, there have been
% calls for a move away from the view of neighborhoods as fixed-static
% containers and towards one where neighborhoods undergo dynamic evolution that
% requires study in its own right. Despite the recent renewed interest in
% neighborhood effects and neighborhood dynamics, these two literatures remain
% largely separate.

% This special issue seeks to redress this situation by bringing together recent
% work at the intersection of neighborhood effects and dynamics. We are inviting
% submissions dedicated to a special issue of Geographical Analysis on
% Neighborhood Dynamics and Neighborhood Effects. Papers in the following areas
% are particularly welcome, as long as they pertain to the general theme of the
% special issue:

% Neighborhood as context
% Neighborhood change
% Neighborhood exposure histories
% Spatial data science approaches to the neighborhood construct
% Neighborhood effects
% Longitudinal analysis of neighborhoods
% Boundary change and harmonization
% Use of novel data sources in neighborhood analysis
% Innovative qualitative, mixed-methods, or quantitative approaches for
% analyzing neighborhood dynamics or effects
% Geodemographic approaches
% Submissions will be refereed according to the standard procedures of Geographical Analysis.

\begin{abstract}
	This paper proposes a novel method for processing spatio-temporal information
	for data-driven identification of neighbourhoods and their dynamics.  Using a
	simple network representation, the method enables longitudinal analysis of
	regions \emph{without the need for geographical harmonisation}. The proposed
	method therefore sidesteps a laborious and error-prone process that is
	nevertheless currently used in virtually all longitudinal analysis of
	region-based data.
    
  To allow for a transparent corroboration of our method, we use it as a basis
  for an interactive and intuitive interface for the progressive exploration of
  the results. The interface gives direct access to the original data to both
  experts and non-experts, allowing users to characterize broad patterns of
  stability and change and identify detailed local processes.

  
  We validate our method with illustrative scenarios from Chicago, Toronto, and
  Los Angeles, with results that match recent literature. The system is publicly
  available, with data from the decennial censuses for over forty regions in the
  USA and Canada between 1970 and 2010, but the methodology is suitable for any
  region-based data.

\section{Conclusion}
The objective of this work was to demonstrate that longitudinal studies of
evolving regions can be performed without geographical harmonisation. We
proposed an alternative methodology that robustly considers the data in its
original geography, without the creation of arbitrary artificial data points.

This methodology was then used to create a publicly accessible system, with an
interactive and intuitive interface, allowing a transparent evaluation and
replication of our results. We used this interface to corroborate results from
the literature and we hope that it will be used to corroborate future results as
well. 

The feedback from experts was positive and most of them were able to extract
insight from the prototype while indicating interest in using it for their
research efforts. Indeed, the experts also demonstrated further interest in
similar tools, indicating that visual analytics methods that leverage user
interaction can be valuable in this field.  Since our interface can be used by
non-experts as well, we also contributed to scientific dissemination and
stakeholder transparency in urban sciences.


More importantly, we introduced a new idea that, apparently, was never
considered in the literature. While significant resources have been invested to
improve geographical harmonisation, rarely if at all has anybody doubted that it
was really necessary in the first place. We proved that it is not necessary, at
least for the vast majority of demographic studies, especially for
neighbourhood effects and neighbourhood dynamics.

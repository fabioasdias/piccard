\section{Illustrative scenarios}
\label{sec:study}

We used decennial census data from the United States~\cite{nhgis} and
Canada\footnote{\url{http://datacentre.chass.utoronto.ca/census/}}, tabulated by
CTs,  from 1970 to 2010. The prototype allows access to 40 regions, 28 in the US
and 12 in Canada. Due to the high number of CTs, New York City was split into
its boroughs. 


We used five aspects for the USA: Education level, Family income, Marital
status, Occupation, and Race; and seven for Canada: Age, Education level, Home
language, Household Income, Marital status, Occupation, Place of birth, and
Religion.  While our method does not require geographic harmonization, it
requires matching variables over time. The supplementary material contains the
details of which census columns were used for each aspect. Income is slightly
inaccurate, even though we did correct for inflation. We grouped the original ranges into
three larger ranges, but they do not match precisely.

%  quantile ranges for \emph{Four or more years of College}. While there was an
%  increase in the whole city (gray band), it was sharper in this
%  region.\label{fig:teaser}}

\subsection{Los Angeles}
We selected a region around the metropolitan area of Los Angeles (LA). This
region follows urban density, not administrative boundaries. The summary of the
results using all aspects with equal weights and eight clusters is illustrated
in Figure~\ref{fig:la}, while the statistical description of the clusters is
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:laAll}, where the most relevant aspect of each
cluster is highlighted. From the trajectories plot, we can see that there is a
large but shrinking cluster, depicted in green, one increasing cluster in
purple, an almost constant orange cluster, a smaller but increasing pink
cluster, and three other small clusters. The corresponding map illustrates where
these clusters are located, and that they are somewhat geographically stable,
with some movement between the green, orange, and purple clusters.

\begin{figure}
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{LA.pdf}
    \caption{Result for Los Angeles with 8 clusters, including three small and
        ephemeral clusters. Cluster characterization is displayed
        in Figure~\ref{fig:laAll}.\label{fig:la}}
\end{figure}

From Figure~\ref{fig:laAll}, we can see that the green cluster is characterized by
a high percentage of White population, low percentage of population in the
lowest income bracket, mostly administrative occupations, and about 30\% of the
population with four or more years of college. The orange cluster is
characterized by a high percentage of Black population, with few people in the
highest range of income and education. The purple cluster corresponds to a high
concentration of "Other" in race, which includes Hispanic for this dataset, high
concentration of Laborers, and low education and income. The pink cluster
contains a high percentage of Asian population and about 30\% of the population
with four or more years of college. The light green cluster contains very few
people in the lower income bracket, mostly White population, with the highest
percentage of population with four or more years of college, working
administrative jobs, and a high concentration of singles. The yellow cluster
represents Black population, with higher level of education and income, mostly
working administrative jobs. The brown cluster represent a majority of single
population, working administrative jobs with mostly low income. The dark gray
cluster is characterized by all its population in the lowest income bracket, low
education level, with a majority of White population.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{laAll.pdf}
    \caption{Full characterization of the eight clusters found for LA. The red
     rectangles indicate the most relevant aspects for each
     cluster.\label{fig:laAll}}
\end{figure*}

Further, the larger clusters, green, orange, and purple, present a significant
intra-cluster variance in most variables, as indicated by the maximum and
minimum whiskers of the boxplots. For instance, while fifty percent of the CTs
in the green cluster have between 20\% and 40\% of people in the lowest income
bracket, that cluster also includes CTs where none and all the population
belongs to that bracket. This might indicate that this cluster could be further
divided, and currently represents different groups of people that are not
different enough to be separated into clusters in this level of the hierarchy.


While the larger clusters are expected, the light green, brown, and dark gray
clusters are more surprising. These clusters are small and ephemeral, including
only a few CTs, and are peculiarly different enough to be separated into their
own clusters, at this level of the hierarchy. While these small clusters might
be interesting enough to warrant further study, they might suppress larger, but
more subtle, clusters from appearing in this interface,  due to the limited
number of clusters.

The orange area in the map in Figure~\ref{fig:la} presents movement, indicated by
the presence of green and purple tones mixed with the orange, which may warrant
further exploration. By clicking on the orange bar above the boxplot, we select
all trajectories that contain the orange cluster. The corresponding details are
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:labh}. This shows a location change, where the
orange cluster is progressively replaced by the purple cluster on its east side,
and in turn expanding to the west. Interestingly, the population increased, the
racial profile changed, but the distribution of income was reasonably stable,
with a higher amount of the population in the lowest income range and very few
people in the highest income range. Indeed, the income  difference is
significant when compared to the city-wide distribution.

\begin{figure}
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{laBH.pdf}
    \caption{Top: Geographic changes in the majority Black population cluster
    (orange) and Laborers cluster (green). Bottom: Income evolution for this
    region (black) and the whole city (gray).\label{fig:labh}}
\end{figure}


A portion of this region is classified into the green cluster in 2010,
indicating a majority white population. To further understand that change, we
clear the current selection, and select all regions that changed from orange in
1970 to green in 2010, using the transition matrix. A portion of the resulting
region, near the Florence-Graham region, is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:laVol},
along with the temporal evolution of Race. Despite this difference, the other
aspects are similar to the ones from the region in Figure~\ref{fig:labh}, with
slightly lower income and education profiles. While the racial aspect changed
considerably, the economic and educational aspects stayed the same.

\begin{figure}
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{laVol.pdf}
    \caption{Details for a volatile region contained in the area of
         Figure~\ref{fig:labh}. This region went from Black to Hispanic to
        White.\label{fig:laVol}}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Toronto}

We considered a region that is approximately the administrative border of the
current city of Toronto and all seven available aspects. The results are
summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:to}, considering eight clusters.

\begin{figure}
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{to.pdf}
    \caption{Results for Toronto, with eight clusters.\label{fig:to}}
\end{figure}

The population with low percentage of University degrees is represented in
orange, mostly anglophone population in green, Asian immigrants in yellow, high
percentage of income in the highest bracket in purple, high percentage of Jewish
people in light green and brown, high percentage of Eastern Non-Christian
religion in pink, and high concentration of single people in dark gray. 


From the trajectories plot, we can see that Toronto is more dynamic than both
Chicago and LA, with one cluster constantly shrinking, and others growing more
prominent. In the 1970s, the city was divided into four clusters: low number of
university degrees, Jewish population, majority anglophones, and high income,
with the latter being rather small. There is some variance in the other
characteristics of the orange cluster, but none as significant as the education
level, especially when compared to the other years. While the orange cluster
persists until 2011, the other clusters present have similar education profiles
to one another, leading the clustering method to use other aspects to
characterize them.

Toronto's dynamism also appears in that we see the influx of Asian population
starting in the 1980s and building thereafter, as represented by the yellow and
pink clusters. While both include a high percentage of people born in Asia, the
pink region is more defined by religion, with low percentage of university
degrees, and contains the lowest percentage  of people in the highest income
bracket for these clusters; the yellow is less defined by religion, and has
higher education and income, geographically corresponding to the Markham region,
know for its Chinese population. A similar division also happens for the two
Jewish clusters, where the light green cluster has lower education and income
levels than the brown cluster. The purple cluster of high income is somewhat
stable. This cluster includes until 2011 the Bridle Path neighborhood, known for
its wealthy population.  In 2011, however, it was classified into the yellow
cluster that includes Asian immigration, since about 35\% of the population for
this CT were born in Asia.  It maintained its income profile, with 85\% with 90k
CAD or more.


The grey regions of the map are another indication of Toronto's volatility over
this period. While there is a cluster that is painted dark grey, annotated by a
red circle in Figure~\ref{fig:to}, the light gray regions on the north part of the
city indicate volatility. Here the same region was classified into three or more
clusters for this five census period. Using the 'Add' mode for the trajectory
selection, we select these volatile regions. A subset of the details is
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:toVol}. 

\begin{figure}
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{toVol.pdf}
    \caption{Details for some regions of Toronto that were classified into 3 or
         more clusters over time.\label{fig:toVol}}
\end{figure}

These regions account for about 5\% of Toronto's population. The whole region
was classified into the orange cluster in 1971 (low level of university degrees).
By 1991, most of the region was classified into the green cluster, representing
anglophone population, mostly Canadian born, with a higher level of education.
As the corresponding plot indicates, this trend in increasing education is
city-wide, but this region has people with better education than most.

In 2001, the purple cluster of high income annexes neighboring parts of the
volatile region, and the Asian born population increases sharply, as illustrated
by the appearance of the yellow cluster.  This cluster, once again, indicates
well educated, higher income, and about 30\%-50\% Asian born population. By
2011, the yellow cluster increased considerably, annexing parts of the high
income purple cluster, including the neighboring Bridle Path area.


While Toronto is more dynamic than Los Angeles, possibly due to size
differences, the volatile regions shown in Figure~\ref{fig:toVol} did not change as
quickly or dramatically as the ones shown in Figure~\ref{fig:laVol}, which involved
twice as many people. We found this trend to be related to the countries
themselves, Canadian cities have larger areas undergoing slow, gradual changes,
whereas American cities have more general stability, but quicker changes in
smaller scales. The supplementary material contains brief summaries of all the
regions accessible in this prototype.

\section{Expert feedback}
%This could be a big step toward better understanding of evolving urban morphology.
To assess the proposed method, we contacted academic and industry experts in
sociology and urban sciences. The supplementary material contains all our
communication with five experts, identified from A to E. 

Their response was positive,  mentioning that the prototype allows them to
analyze census data without the additional work of obtaining and cleaning the
data (A, B, E), and it allows the inclusion of geographic visual analysis tools
in their research process (D). It enables the users to tell different stories
about neighborhoods/cities and their changes (A), visualize the relationship
between key urban variables over time (D), offering a quick way to identify
particular neighborhoods that one may be interested in studying more in depth
around a particular issue or efficiently understanding the context of an area
(E).  Indeed, the experts identified gentrification processes in Manhattan (B)
and Dallas (E), reinforced a hypothesis for occupational clustering (D), and
highlighted how the method can be used to compare neighborhoods and cities (A).
These remarks attest that we satisfied the design requirements regarding the
existing demographic groups and their changes.



While the interface was "easy to navigate" (B), it was also considered
"overwhelming" (A), "intimidating" (E), and "tricky to interpret" (C), possible
side-effects of our effort to increase  representational accuracy, where we
avoided using simplified labels. Specifically, while identifying clusters by
their most relevant variables was welcome, the overlap of information from
different clusters in the boxplot was "a bit confusing" (C). While the map of
trajectories was mentioned as a "good summary map", how it related to the
clustering method was unclear (C). While we provide different options on how the
colors are used on this map, both are sub optimal, reliably representing several
distinct entities using colors is still an open problem in visualization.


The experts also mentioned the poor responsiveness of the method when changes in
the clustering parameters required server-side processing (B,D). Indeed, the
current implementation can take a few minutes to cluster regions with high
number of CTs, like Los Angeles or Brooklyn.

Most of the experts demonstrated interest in using our method in their research
(A, B, D, E), aiming to use the census data as a backdrop for other datasets,
providing demographic context. They also mentioned the need to export subsets of
data, plots, and maps to be used in reports and publications (C, D, E).


More importantly, while these experts were aware that our method does not
perform geographic normalization, none of them mention it. We did not
specifically ask if this difference led to unexpected results, but rather
inquired if they found interesting insights, leading them to consider the
interface, its options, and results as a whole. Therefore the method was
neutrally compared against other, traditionally normalized results. We interpret
the fact that most of them were interested in the next steps as an affirmation
of the accuracy of the method.

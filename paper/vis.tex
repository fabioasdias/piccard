\abstract{Census measurements provide reliable demographic data going back
centuries. However, their analysis is often hampered by the lack of geographical
consistency across time. We propose a visual analytics system that enables the
exploration of geographically inconsistent data. Our method also includes
incremental developments in the representation, clustering, and visual
exploration of census data, allowing an easier  understanding of the demographic
groups present in a city and their evolution over time. We present the feedback
of experts in urban sciences and sociology, along with illustrative scenarios in
the USA and Canada.}

\section{Conclusions}
Our objective was to allow for the exploration of census data without
geographical normalization, an approach that is usually not considered:
\emph{"(...) tract-by-tract comparison is not possible unless data from 2000 is
interpolated to 2010 boundaries (...)"}~\cite{Dmowska2017}. Our method was able
to corroborate previous findings from the specialized literature, with an
increased level of detail due to our data representation and visualization
choices. The feedback from experts was remarkably positive, most of them were
able to extract insight from the prototype and demonstrated interest in using it
on their research efforts.

While we focused on census data in this work, the proposed method can be used
with most similarly area-based datasets. Further, while there is interest in the
use of census data, it is mostly in combination with other, larger and more
dynamic, datasets. We postulate that, while census data is interesting, the
amount of effort required to obtain and prepare it often discourages its use as
complementary information, reinforcing our hypothesis that there is need for
methods that are able to deal with geographically inconsistent data.

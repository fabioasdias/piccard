        <p>If you just want to know how to play with the interface, <a
        href="#ui">skip ahead to the prototype interface documentation</a>, or
        <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZFUA0ThEaY&list=PLBd6KRI4PG-RcxAX35OfHd1DKl3qWfXRV">the

        <p>The objective of this page is to briefly overview the data and
        methods used and explain how to interpret the results illustrated in the
        interface. No expert knowledge is required beyond a basic grasp of
        statistics (specifically, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot">boxplots</a>).</p>

        <h2>Overview and objectives</h2>
        <p>The objective of this prototype is to <b>explore census data</b>. We employ
        data clustering to simplify the information, which is fairly commonplace
        for this type of analysis. In this scenario, a cluster is a set of
        geographic regions that are more similar to themselves than to the other
        regions.</p>
        <p>The objectives of this project are:
            <ul>
                    <li>Make evident what clusters are present in a geographic region (city, metro, etc).</li>
                    <li>Understand how these clusters evolved over time, both spatially and in content.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>     
        
            
        <h2>Data</h2>
            <p>We used data from <a
            href="https://data2.nhgis.org/main">NHGIS</a>, for the USA, using
            census years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010, and from <a
            href="http://dc.chass.utoronto.ca/census/">CHASS</a> for Canada,
            census years 1971, 1981, 1991, 2001, and 2011. Neither allows
            redistribution of the data, which is why our prototype does not
            export the results in a downloadable format. In both cases, we used
            <b>census tracts</b> as the basic geographic unit.</p>

            <p>
            When dealing with census data, the main challenge is the lack of
            uniformity on the measurements. Everything changes, from the shapes
            of the census tracts, to what variables are measured and what each
            measured variable actually means. <b>Here the spatial changes do not
            matter, because the method was developed specifically to deal with
            different geographic regions</b>, but we still had to find the
            correspondences between the variables across different years. Since
            the objective of this work is to demonstrate that the prototype
            works, not do a deep analysis, we only matched a subset of the
            available variables, just enough for it to be useful, we hope.
            
            <p>More importantly, we did not consider each measurement as a
            separate entity, but we grouped them into aspects (for lack of a
            better term). Each aspect is then characterised by a probability
            distribution of its values. For instance, the aspect "Race" in the
            USA includes White; Black; Indian, eskimo and aleut; Asian,
            Hawaiian, other pacific islander; and other.</p>
            <p> Since each aspect is a
            probability distribution (a histogram, to be precise), we can
            compare any two regions without further concerns. There are many
            ways to compare two probability distributions, but we adopted a
            simple euclidean distance between the vectors, because it gave
            reasonable results and it is fast to compute.
            </p>

            <a name="income"></a>
            <p><b style="color:red">ATTENTION - INCOME</b>: While some aspects
            match perfectly between census years (age, for one), income does
            not. We adjusted the values using publicly available inflation data
            and considered rather large ranges, but the results are not
            absolutely reliable. They are not wrong either, as far as we know,
            but should be <b>interpreted with extreme caution</b>. For instance, there
            is a "baseline" oscillation in all cities of both countries, most
            likely caused by a slight mismatch in the values, that should not be
            confused with actual change in the data. Additionally, accurately
            adjusting historical monetary values is a challenging problem by
            itself, and out of the scope here.

            <p>For the USA, we used: Education level, Family Income, Marital

            language, Household income, Marital status, Occupation, Place of
            birth, and Religion</p>


        <h2>Clustering method</h2>
            <h3>Data representation and geographic relationships</h3>
                <p>
                   One of the distinctive features of this work is that we use a
                   <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graph</a> to represent the census tracts. Each CT is represented
                   as node, with probability distributions of each aspect, and
                   we place edges between the nodes of CTs that share geographic
                   boundaries. Since we also have temporal evolution, we connect
                   the graphs of each year by linking regions that spatially
                   overlap, leading to a single graph (with possibly several
                   connected components). That graph is the data used for the
                   whole method, and its inherent flexibility is what allows us
                   to compare different geographic regions over time (no need
                   for harmonized regions into a single CT division). In other
                   words, <b>the data is not a matrix</b>.</p>
                        
                        
                        

            <h3>Watershed cuts and hierarchies</h3>

                <p>The actual clustering method is based on the <a
                href="https://hal-upec-upem.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00622410/document">Watershed
                cuts</a> algorithm for graphs, coupled with a <a
                href="http://sibgrapi2017.ic.uff.br/e-proceedings/assets/papers/TP/147.pdf">greedy
                edge matching method</a>,leading to a result that is not a
                single clustering, but a hierarchy. This hierarchical result is
                what allows the easy change in the numbers of clusters, without
                the need to redo the computational process. We limit the number
                of clusters to eight because we cannot visually display more
                than that using colours.
            </p>

            <h3>Aspect Weights</h3>
                <p>The user can assign different weights to each aspect. By
                default, their values are equal to one. Use this parameter to
                increase/decrease the importance of the <i>differences</i> in each
                aspect. For instance, using "Race" with weight one and "Income"
                with weight two means that a difference in race needs to have
                twice the value as one in income to be equally distinctive,
                leading to a clustering that mostly considers differences in
                Income, using Race as a "tie breaker" of sorts.</p>

            <h3>Augmented edges</h3>
                <p>One slight caveat of Watershed cuts is that each cluster is
                composed of a connected subgraph of the original graph. In other
                words, if we have two separate sets of census tracts, with
                identical features (aspects), they will form two distinct
                clusters, which is not ideal for this specific application.
                    </p>
                    


                <p>To overcome this, we augment the original graph with two
                edges from a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_graph">K-NN
                graph</a>, generated without considering the geographic
                information. In this example, these edges will connect the two
                previously disconnected regions, assigning both regions to the
                same cluster. 
                </p>


        <a name="ui"></a>
        <h2>Prototype interface</h2>
            

            <h3 style="color:red">Important</h3> 
                <p>This tool is still in the <i>prototype</i> phase. That means
                it should work, using Chrome (Safari might crash due to heavy
                memory usage), but it will crash sometimes. We tried to mitigate
                this, by breaking NYC into boroughs for instance, but problems
                are still possible, especially when analysing larger regions
                (LA, Greater Toronto, Vancouver, San Francisco). </p>

                <p>The results are computed on request <i>on the server</i>,
                then saved and reused if the same configuration is requested
                again. The default configuration is probably already saved for
                every region, so the results are generally fast to load.
                However, more "exotic" parameters (custom weights, removing
                variables) will need to be processed, and that might take a
                while (around 5 minutes for Chicago/LA/etc). When that happens,
                the page might crash, or just get stuck with the "loading"
                message forever. Just refresh the page after a few minutes and
                try again, the server will have processed the request and it
                should load quickly. I do apologise for this.</p>
            

            <h3>Trajectories</h3>
                <p>For each little piece of the region under analysis we can
                associate the corresponding clusters over time. We call this
                sequence a <i>trajectory</i>.</p>

            <h3>The interface</h3>

                <p>When loaded, the interface will show a default configuration for an
                arbitrary region.  </p>


                <P>The bottom part of the left panel contains an overview of what
                composes each cluster, where you can click on the arrow to see a
                detailed composition of each cluster or click on the 'view all'
                button to see all the features that composed all of the clusters at
                the same time. You can also click on the coloured bar besides the
                arrow to have an overview of that specific cluster.</P>

                <p>The region and the clustering parameters can be altered by
                clicking on the gear located on the top left side. This panels
                allows the user to add or remove other aspects, and set the
                desired weights for each feature. To run the new configuration,
                just click on the run button.</p>

                    <img src="conf.png">
                </center>

                <p>After the page is loaded, you can see the current configuration
                shown on the top left. Below you can choose if you want "simplified
                colours", as shown in the section <a href="colours">Colours,
                simplified?</a>, and adjust the number of clusters. </p>

                    <img width="95%" src="chicago_Race_e1.png">
                </center>

                <p>Clicking on any coloured region on the left and top
                panels will select the corresponding trajectories and update
                the bottom panel to show details about these regions. How
                these selections are made can be configured using the
                selection mode combo box. </p>

                <p>The default 'set' option will replace any current
                selection with whatever trajectories are chosen next. 'Add'
                will add the new trajectories to the currently selected, and
                'remove' will remove from it. The 'x' button on this panel
                clear the current selection. The bottom part of the
                interface will update the details accordingly.</p>

                <p>For example, if you click on the green bar of the year 2010,
                you will be able to see all the trajectories that belong to the
                green cluster in that year. By clicking on the individual edges,
                you can select a single trajectory. Alternatively, trajectories
                can be manipulated  by clicking on regions on the top right map
                or on the cluster changes matrix.</p>

                <p>The other panels on the top displays how the clusters evolved
                over time (the different trajectories)Here, you can also click
                on different parts of said trajectories to further analyze them.
                For example, choosing Chicago, Race with weight 1, we can
                clearly see three main colours and trajectories that go from the
                year 1970 to the year 2010. Now, this is the first general
                overview you get, but you may be interested in something more
                specific, like what regions remained the same over the years by
                clicking on the coloured lines between the bars representing the
                years.</p>

                <p>On the middle top panel, the percentage of changes between
                them is shown, and an overview map, illustrating the cluster
                evolution for the whole considered period.</p>
                
                <p>The bottom part of the interface contains the details for the
                selected regions, with maps illustrating which CTs are used,
                since they can be different over time, and plot comparing the
                selected region against the whole.</p>
                    

            <h3>Overview of cluster composition</h3>

            <p>The left panel contains one boxplot per cluster, illustrating the
            aspect that better characterises that cluster. <b>It was not
            necessarily used for the clustering</b>, but it is the one with less
            overlap between the 25% and 75% quantiles. We define relevance as
            the distance between the interquartile ranges, meaning that an
            aspect is relevant if those specific values are not present in the
            other classes. The relevance of an aspect is the maximum relevance
            of its composing variables.</p>
            <p>The relevance is represented by the colour of the interquartile
            box. The whiskers represent the maximum and minimum. To allow for an
            easier comparison, the quantiles of the other clusters are
            represented in gray. The user can expand that panel and see all the
            aspects of that cluster, or all of them at the same time.</p>
            

                <center>
                    <img src="chicago_e1_expOv.png">
                </center>
                <p>In this image, we can see that the yellow cluster corresponds
                a concentration (~70%) of people that identify as "Asian,
                Hawaiian, other pacific islander" and that this is unique to
                this cluster. The other boxplots are ordered by relevance, left
                to right, but there are no more relevant aspects, with all
                "boxes" almost in the same position. This means that, while Race
                is a relevant aspect for this clustering, the other variables
                are not, and have similar values across the different clusters.
                This can be confirmed by clicking on "view all":</p>

            <h3>Trajectories</h3>
               <p>We defined a <i>trajectory</i> as the sequence of clusters
                assigned to a specific region. This allows for the study of the
                <b>changes</b> in the demographic groups.</p>

                <p>The trajectories are depicted using a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram">Sankey
                diagram</a>, where the width is proportional to the population involved.</p>
                <center>
                    <img src="chicago_e1_sankey.png">
                </center>
                <p>We can see that the green cluster contains more people,
                followed by the orange, and that the yellow cluster is small.
                The clusters are mostly stable, with a large trajectory composed
                by the green cluster on all times. A better explanation on the
                colour choices is <a href="#colours">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Another way of identifying change is using the cluster
                changes matrix, which indicates the percentage of the population
                of a given cluster that was later classified into another
                cluster.</p>

                <center>
                        <img src="chicago_e1_transmat.png">
                </center>
                <p>In this image, we can see that, considering all years, 95% of
                the population in the green cluster stayed green, while 5%
                became orange and 1% yellow. The total is not 100% due to
                rounding. The panel on the top right depicts the geographic
                positions of the trajectories, considering all years (the other
                maps show the clustering results for specific years).</p>
    
                <p>More importantly, <b>the user can select (multiple)
                trajectories</b>. The "Selection mode" control on the left panel
                allows the user to Set the selection, Add to the selection, or
                remove from it. The button next to it clears the selection. The
                bottom part of the interface will then show details for the
                selected trajectories (or for the whole, if nothing is
                selected).

            <h3>Colours, simplified?</h3>
                <p>In this work, we use colours to represent the clusters and
                the trajectories. That is the reason the number of clusters is
                limited to 8, we cannot really tell colours apart beyond that.
                However, we have considerably more trajectories, so we are left
                with a conundrum: Do we accurately represent each different
                trajectory with a different colour or do we use small set of
                colours and paint different, but similar, trajectories in the
                same colour? Well, instead of "solving" this problem, we made
                both options available, let the users decide. </p>

                <p><b>Simplified colours</b>: When this is active, the colours
                on the interface are determined by the rule:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If a region belongs to the same cluster on all
                        years, use the colour of that cluster,</li>
                        <li>If a region belongs to a given cluster for most of
                        the years (simple majority), use a "lighter" version of
                        the colour of the cluster,</li>
                        <li>Gray otherwise.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p><b>Non-simplified colours</b>:When this is <b>not</b> active, the
                colours on the interface are determined as the average of the
                colours of the involved clusters.
                </p>

            <h3>Characterization of the selected trajectories</h3>
                <p>The bottom part of the interface corresponds to the
                <i>details</i>, either for the whole region under analysis or
                the selected trajectories.</p>

                <p>Following the Chicago example, this is what happens when the
                user selects all trajectories involving the yellow cluster (by
                clicking on the yellow bar over the boxplot)</p>

                </center>

                <p>The population numbers, under the maps, now consider only the
                selected CTs (displayed in the maps), along with the
                corresponding percentage of the population (wrt the whole).</p>

                <p>Under it, we have one row for each aspect, with rectangles
                that represent the average proportion of each subpart of the
                aspect. We can easily see that about half of the population in
                these regions is married, for instance. Each aspect can be
                expanded, revealing more details, including a comparison against
                the whole region, in this image, Race is expanded. The black
                area corresponds to the interquartile ranges for the selection,
                the dashed line to the maximum and minimum for the selection,
                the gray area corresponds to the global interquartile ranges.

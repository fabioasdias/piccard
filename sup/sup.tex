\section{Original request for feedback}
As part of our efforts in \censure{the Urban Genome} Project of the
\censure{University of Toronto}, we are trying to build infrastructure to help
understand recurrent and distinctive patterns of urban change.

This effort has led to a prototype interface to allow the visual exploration of
census data. While we plan to add additional data sources, the objective of this
prototype is to facilitate interpretation of census data, minimizing the need
for specialised analytical tools. Hopefully this will allow non-experts to be
able to gain insight from it, but we believe that it can be helpful to experts
as well.  

This prototype is part of an article, and we are humbly requesting feedback on
how effective it actually is.

The documentation that briefly explains what we did is available at:

\censure{\href{http://ug.daniels.utoronto.ca/~diasf/CTEvo/doc.html}{\url{http://ug.daniels.utoronto.ca/~diasf/CTEvo/doc.html}}}

The video guides demonstrating how to use the tool are available at:

\censure{\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZFUA0ThEaY&list=PLBd6KRI4PG-RcxAX35OfHd1DKl3qWfXRV}{youtube}}

And the prototype itself is available at:

\censure{\href{http://ug.daniels.utoronto.ca/~diasf/CTEvo/}{\url{http://ug.daniels.utoronto.ca/~diasf/CTEvo/}}}

The prototype should work on all major browsers, but in our experience Chrome
seems to offer the best performance.

Should you chose to provide feedback, we will add it, verbatim, to the
supplementary material of the paper (along with this text), and excerpts of it
may be used in the paper itself. If you do not wish for some information to be
publicly available, including your name/affiliation, please let us know.

Specifically, we would like more information regarding:

\question{Does this prototype make the exploration of census data easier?}
 

It definitely does! With the visualizations, we can tell many different stories
about neighborhoods/cities and their changes over time without doing the “dirty
work” of analyzing raw/big census data.
 

 

\question{By using it, did you find anything interesting? Either new insight or
something that demonstrates/disproves an established insight? }
 

This program demonstrates how specific combinations of local characteristics can
create distinctive or comparable scenes. As such, neighborhoods and cities can
be studied and compared in a way that the unit of sociological/urban analysis is
scenes.
 
 
\question{What questions would you be interested in pursuing further with this tool?}
 

We can perhaps develop measures based on cluster changes that could capture
whether a city or a neighborhood has become more diverse or homogeneous, and
also in terms of different aspects (e.g., race/ethnicity, SES, religion, and
immigration). It will also be interesting to explore whether different clusters
would shape other aspects of the neighborhoods and cities, such as trust, voting
pattern, and population movement.
 
 
\question{What would you add/remove/change on it?}
 

Instead of presenting everything on one overwhelming webpage (!), I would maybe
create multiple pages for different sections (e.g., configuration, choose
different cities), and embed them into one home page. Or maybe use popups for
results?
 
 
Overall, it is a very cool program, and I can see huge potential as a tool for
survey data visualization. For example, we can develop similar tools to
visualize the U.S. General Social Survey across different states from 1972-2016.

Very cool visualization tool! To answer your questions:

\question{Does this prototype make the exploration of census data easier?}

Yes, absolutely. Census data can be difficult to download and clean, especially
for people who are not familiar with statistical software packages.

\question{By using it, did you find anything interesting? Either new insight or
something that demonstrates/disproves an established insight?}

I focused on Manhattan, since this is near where I currently live (Jersey City,
New Jersey). The visualization tool confirmed the gentrification of Manhattan,
with the exception of some areas (e.g., Chinatown and parts of the Lower East
Side). I'd like to know more about who lives in the Lower East Side. Is there a
conscious effort to resist gentrification in that part of the city, or is it
just a consequence of limited public transportation to the area, or is something
else going on?
 
\question{What questions would you be interested in pursuing further with this tool? }

I would like to see other data incorporated into the tool -- e.g., "cultural"
data involving consumption practices. Of course, it's no easy feat to obtain
these data, let alone merge into a geographic information system.

\question{What would you add/remove/change on it?}

Overall I enjoyed using the visualization tool and I found it easy to navigate.
I have two suggestions. First, I would work on speeding up the code that loads
the tool. Even after several minutes I could not load the Brooklyn data on
various browsers, for example. Second, as far as changes to the interface, my
only recommendation is to place the choice of various locations in a more
prominent place. Typically I think of the "Gear" icon as representing more
technical options, but the first change I made was altering the location.

\textbf{Overall assessment}

As a first impression, I think the tool needs a brief summary of what it does
and how can people play with it. It took me a while between reading the
documentation and playing with it to make sense of what was going on underneath.
Maybe having a 5-minute tutorial would solve the problem, with someone (a voice
and captions) showing the user what’s going on in each section of the interface.
This has helped me in the past dealing with new software.

I really like the idea of the colours having the additional tag of the feature
that defines them more clearly on the left. However, once one starts playing
around with the platform using several variables at the same time, things become
tricky to interpret. For example, in Vancouver, things seem to change
dramatically from all green to all orange. This is highlighted by the graph of
trajectories in which the population involved in each cluster is nested in
colours. Once one gets into the data, the changes don't look so sharp after all
(maybe in education and income). This may not be a problem of the platform as it
is, but there may be a warning regarding that the “severity” of changes is not
necessarily the same across cities. 

Related to my previous point, in some cities the interpretation of the patterns
is clearer than in others. I think the platform works great in Montreal, for
instance. With a little knowledge about the city, the clustering makes a lot of
sense in how the composition has evolved. 

\textbf{Some specifics}

\begin{itemize}
    \item{For the boxplots, overlapping the gray ones in the back to show the
            difference with other clusters is a bit confusing, especially for
            those with no colour in them. Maybe a different colour or more
            transparency would help. }

    \item{I have trouble making sense of the top-right map. In the documentation
            it’s described as “the geographic positions of the trajectories,
            considering all years (the other maps show the clustering results
            for specific years).” While this is clear, it seems a little tricky
            to interpret. Is it the clustering adding all years together? Is it
            calculated as an average trajectory? How is that interpreted?
            Overall, I thought this to be a good summary map, but it has such an
            importance in the interface that I think obscures the fact that the
            maps below show, as a whole, how the trajectories move over time.}

    \item{If, as a user, I wanted to get a simple output for a presentation, it
            would be ideal to get the sequence of maps to show the changes over
            time. I could get a screenshot but providing it as a potential
            product would be very useful. A more sophisticated version would
            include a GIF image, but that may be harder to do and not so popular
            for other users beyond me.}
\end{itemize}

\question{Does this prototype make the exploration of census data easier?}

The prototype allows me to visualize the relationship between key urban
variables over time and easily explore  what variables distinguish spaces from
each other. As someone who can’t make my own maps, I usually have to wait until
the end of a project before I start to commission visuals. I only have the
luxury of visualizing data that I fully understand (or think I fully understand
at least).  This tool allows me to use visualization as a tool in my own
research process.  

 

\question{By using it, did you find anything interesting? Either new insight or
 something that demonstrates/disproves an established insight? What questions
 would you be interested in pursuing further with this tool? }

 
The spatial analysis  supports speculative reasoning from [1] about the return
to central cities and central business districts of moneyed, educated, knowledge
workers. They hypothesized that this transition happened over the past 20 years
and  that it is more complete in a set of metros with high levels of
‘post-industrialism’. The tools helps to verify this analysis and show that
occupational clustering is robust in many cities, even when orthogonal measures
are added.  This tool can be used to formally extend the analysis to the full
range of metros.

\question{What would you add/remove/change on it?}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{More summary statistics about the clusters would be very useful (density,
  population, distance from transit etc)}
  \item{A tool that would allow us to  point to a cluster and find similar clusters in
  other neighborhoods would be most useful.}
  \item{It would be great to have a quick way to snap pictures, as well as a
  tool to export data in to CSV}
  \item{We would appreciate the ability to restrict the analysis to an interval
  within. For the analysis above 2000-2010 might be useful}
  \item{Processing speed is an issue that I'm sure will be resolved in time}
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{E\censure{ - James Murdoch}}
\censure{\emph{Policy Analyst at 2M Research, USA}}

Wow!! This is quite an undertaking and I definitely see the potential of this
tool for understanding neighborhood dynamics overtime. Here are some uses I see

It offers a quick way to identify particular neighborhoods (i.e. Census tracts)
that one may be interested in studying more in depth around a particular issue.
A good example is gentrification. I was able to use the tool to identify several
neighborhoods in Dallas that I know have gentrified over the years by looking at
how race/education/income changed since 1970. You can also easily see when the
neighborhood “tipped” as the cluster color will change. That is quite a feat as
without this tool just getting all the necessary data is a lot of work. Plus
being able to see a neighborhood change from black dominated to white dominated,
for example, is really powerful. Its really a nice tool for efficiently
understanding the context of an area. In a program evaluation of some kind of
place-based intervention this tool would be a great way to produce data on the
context in which the intervention is occurring. I could also see it facilitating
descriptive analysis that provides some evidence of how an intervention may
impact a particular place as the tool allows for the analysis of trends. I think
it could be an excellent planning tool for local governments. As more data is
added, the tool will be able to quickly show clusters of particular types of
economic activity, cultural activity, types of residents and consumers, and many
other things that planners may be interested in. It could also serve as a
communication tool for more participatory planning. For example, you could take
an asset-based approach where you highlight the resources in the neighborhood
with the tool and ask residents to react, offer insight, and make suggestions
how to capitalize on what already exists in a neighborhood or city.
 

Some questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Do you think users will ever be able to import their own data? For
example, what if someone had violent crime data from the local police department
that they want to overlay with the other data in the tool. Will that be possible
at some point?}

\item{I know you can’t export raw data, but what about the ability to save a
customized map or some type of data graphic? That would be super useful for
people that need to write reports or do a presentation.}

\item{Any ambitions to include social media info or other “big data” sources
similar to that in here?}
\end{itemize} 

A couple criticisms:

\begin{itemize}
  
  \item{Obviously the tool is still buggy. I had to restart several times. Also
  it would be nice if the big map in the top right also moved the smaller maps
  that correspond to different time points just below it. I notice that moving
  one of the smaller maps moves all the other smaller maps, but moving the big
  map doesn’t do anything. Also I didn’t see a way to enlarge the map. I’d like
  to be able to have a full screen view of the map that I can toggle when
  needed.}
  
  \item{It is a little intimidating at first. I might recommend starting with a
  simpler default (only one variable, less than 5 clusters, etc.) and allow
  people to work up in complexity if they want to. I found it a bit hard to get
  in to it as I had to really think about what I was looking at first.}
\end{itemize}

I really must commend you on your work. This is an amazing tool that you have
put together. Great job and thanks for sharing this with me!! Please keep me
updated as you develop it further. I could definitely see a use for it in the
work I do both in my personal research and at my work at 2M.
